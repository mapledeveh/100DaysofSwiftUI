# <center>Project 12, part 2

Today we’re going to push into more advanced Core Data techniques – the things that really set apps apart when it comes to functionality and usefulness. Some of these will take a little time to learn, particularly because as we push more into Core Data you’ll start to see a little more of its Objective-C underbelly.

Stick with it! As Maya Angelou said, “all great achievements require time” – it will take some work to understand all that Core Data is doing for us here, but it *will* pay off and I feel confident you’ll enjoy using Core Data and SwiftUI together in your apps.

**Today you have three topics to work through, in which you’ll learn about **NSPredicate**, changing fetch requests dynamically, creating relationships, and more.**

At one point you’ll see me say you’ve reached a good point and can move on to the next tutorial, but if you continue beyond that point we’ll explore some more advanced topics. To be quite clear, the extra work is optional: please don’t do it if you’re tight on time, or just want to get the fundamentals down.

- Filtering @FetchRequest using NSPredicate
- Dynamically filtering @FetchRequest with SwiftUI
- One-to-many relationships with Core Data, SwiftUI, and @FetchRequest

Make sure and share your progress with others – it helps keep you focused, plus you’ll meet other folks who are also learning!
