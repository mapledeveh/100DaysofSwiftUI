# <center>Project 2, part 2</center>
One of the things people often complain about while learning to program is that they really want to get busy making The Big App Idea they had, but instead they need to follow tutorials making different apps entirely.

I know this can be annoying, but trust me: nothing you’re learning will be wasted. Sure, you might not ever make a flag guessing game, but the concepts you learn here – building layouts, tracking state, randomizing arrays, and more – will last you for years.

Oprah Winfrey once said, “do what you have to do until you can do what you want to do.” By the end of this 100 days course I hope you’ll be able to do exactly what you want, but in the meantime stick with it – you’re learning key skills here!

**Today you have three topics to work through, in which you’ll apply your knowledge of *VStack, LinearGradient, alerts,* and more.**

 - Stacking up buttons
 - Showing the player’s score with an alert
 - Styling our flags
 - Upgrading our design

Admit it: building a SwiftUI app is fast, isn’t it? Once you know the tools you’re working with, you can turn around a complete game in under 15 minutes, and then just like we did try playing around with the design until you find something you like.
