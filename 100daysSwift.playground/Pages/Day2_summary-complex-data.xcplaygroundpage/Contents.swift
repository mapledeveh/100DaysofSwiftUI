/*: # Summary: Complex data
  - Arrays store many values, and read them using indices.
  - Dictionaries store many values, and read them using keys we specify.
  - Sets stores many values, but we don't choose their order.
  - Enums create our own types to specify a range of acceptable values.
  - Swift uses type inference to figure what data we're storing.
  - It's also possible to use type annotation to force a particular type.
