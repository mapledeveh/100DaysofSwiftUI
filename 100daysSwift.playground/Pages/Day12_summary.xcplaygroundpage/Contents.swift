/*: # Summary: Optionals
 - Optionals let us represent the absence of data.
 - Everything that isn't optional definitely has a value inside.
 - Unwrapping looks inside the optional: if there's a value it's sent back.
 - **if let** runs code if the optional has a value; **guard let** runs code if the optional doesn't have a value.
 - **??** unwraps and returns an optional's value, or a default value instead.
 - Optional chaining reads an optional inside another optional.
 - **try?**d can convert throwing functions so they return an optional.
