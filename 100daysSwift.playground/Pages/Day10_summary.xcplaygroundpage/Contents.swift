/*: # Summary: Classes
 - Classes have lots of things in common with structs.
 - Classes can inherit from other classes, so they get access to the properties and methods of their parent.
 - Swift doesn't generate a memberwise initializer for classes.
 - Copies of a class instance point to the same instance.
 - Classes run deinitializers when the last copy of an instance is destroyed.
 - You can change variable properties inside constant class instances.
