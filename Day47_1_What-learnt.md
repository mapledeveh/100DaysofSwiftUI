# What you learned

Hopefully you felt like these projects started to stretch you a little, not only in pushing your SwiftUI skills further but also teaching you some more advanced Swift. Plus, of course, you also have two new SwiftUI projects that you built – you can go ahead and keep customizing these all you want, put them on GitHub, or perhaps convert them into something else that better suits your tastes.

Here’s a quick recap of all the new things we covered in the last three projects:

- Why **@State** only works with structs.
- How to use **@ObservedObject** to work with classes.
- How **@Published** lets us announce property changes to any SwiftUI views that are watching.
- Presenting and dismissing views using the **sheet()** modifier and the **dismiss** environment key.
- Using **onDelete(perform:)** to enable swipe to delete.
- Adding **EditButton** to navigation bar items, to let users edit list data more easily.
- Reading and writing data with **UserDefaults**.
- Archiving and unarchiving data with **Codable**, including working with data stored in a hierarchy.
- Using the **Identifiable** protocol to make sure all items can be identified uniquely in our user interface.
- How to use **GeometryReader** to make content fit the screen.
- Using **ScrollView** to lay out custom views in a scrollable area.
- Pushing new views onto the navigation stack using **NavigationLink**.
- Using Swift’s generics system to write methods that work with different kinds of data.
- Creating custom paths and shapes.
- Creating shapes that can be inset and have their border stroked, using **InsettableShape**.
- Using **CGAffineTransform** to create rotations and translations.
- Making creative borders and fills using **ImagePaint**.
- Enabling Metal for drawing complex views using **drawingGroup()**.
- Modifying blend modes and saturation.
- Animating shapes with animatableData and **AnimatablePair**.

I hope you’ll agree that’s a lot, and it also spans a wide range – we’ve gone from hard-core language features through to user-facing views, and even further on to creative uses for Swift’s drawing system. Some folks will prefer the pure language stuff and others will prefer the more creative side of coding, and that’s OK – we all learn differently!
