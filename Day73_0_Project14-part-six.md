Project 14, part 6
This was another difficult project, but you made it through and I hope your mind is already thinking of ways you can use the skills you learned. Whether that’s integrating maps for a shopping app, using Face ID to secure data, or something else, every skill you’re learning here will pay off in the long run.

Today we’re on to the review and challenges portion of the project, which is where you can push your skills further with some code of your own. As Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, “unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.” So, think of this as a growth day!

**Today you should work through the wrap up chapter for project 14, complete its review, then work through all three of its challenges.**
