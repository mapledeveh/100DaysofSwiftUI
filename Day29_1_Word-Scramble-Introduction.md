# <center> Word Scramble: Introduction

This project will be another game, although really it's just a sneaky way for me to introduce more Swift and SwiftUI knowledge! The game will show players a random eight-letter word, and ask them to make words out of it. For example, if the starter word is "alarming" they might spell "alarm", "ring", "main", and so on.

Along the way you'll meet **List, onAppear(), Bundle, fatalError()**, and more – all useful skills that you'll use for years to come. You'll also get some practice with **@State, NavigationView**, and more, which you should enjoy while you can – this is our last easy project!

To get started, please create a new App project called WordScramble. You'll need to download the files for this project, as it contains a file called "start.txt" that you'll be needing later on.

OK, let's get into some code…
