# <center> Project 12, part 3

Are you ready for some more challenges?

American singer and songwriter Christina Grimmie once said, “people aren't born strong; People grow stronger little by little, encountering difficult situations, learning not to run from them.” The same is absolutely true of good coders: there’s no magic switch that gets flicked when you’ve been reading books for a year, but instead your skills grow slowly over time as you face – and solve – increasingly hard problems.

I keep encouraging you to tackle these problems because writing your own code, and finding your own solutions, matters. At first there will often be some blank page syndrome – where you stare blankly at the screen, not knowing where to start. But that’s OK, and in fact it’s to be expected. The more you practice the more adept you’ll become at figuring out solutions for yourself, and today is another step towards that goal.

*Today you should work through the wrap up chapter for project 12, complete its review, then work through all three of its challenges.*
