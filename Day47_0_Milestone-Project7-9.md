# <center>Milestone: Projects 7-9
Congratulations on making it through another three projects! You’re probably feeling tired after our drawing technique project, but both today and tomorrow should be a good change of pace – today is a consolidation day, and tomorrow is something a little bit different.

Today’s challenge is an interesting one, and honestly it has such a big potential to be developed into a larger app if you have the time. Days like today are important because they give you an idea that is wholly within your grasp, and give you the time and scope to execute on it. Hopefully you make the most of that – as the astronaut Mae Jemison once said, “I like to think of ideas as potential energy: they're really wonderful, but nothing will happen until we risk putting them into action.”

So, today is an action day: you’ve got lots of coding ahead, plus the potential for more if you want to take the project further. Let’s get into it!

**Today you have three topics to work through, one of which of is your challenge.**

- What you learned
- Key points
- Challenge

**Note:** Don’t worry if you don’t complete challenges in the day they were assigned – in future days you’ll find you have some time to spare here and there, so challenges are something you can return back to in the future.
