# What you learned

These projects began introducing you to the more difficult parts of SwiftUI, although none of it was really SwiftUI’s fault – it’s the places where SwiftUI meets Apple’s older frameworks that things get a little rough. Over time these rough edges will get smoothed off a little, but it might be a few years and regardless these will still be important for any times you want to integrate code from outside of Apple.

While completing the three projects, you also learned:

- How property wrappers become structs
- Presenting confirmation dialogs with lots of buttons
- Using Core Image to manipulate images
- Integrating **PHPickerViewController** into SwiftUI
- Writing coordinator classes that can act as delegates for image pickers
- Integrating maps into SwiftUI
- Dropping pins on maps
- Saving images to the user’s photo library
- Adding **Comparable** conformance to custom types
- Finding and writing to the user’s documents directory
- Enabling file encryption when writing
- Authenticating users with Touch ID and Face ID

Each of those topics were covered as a standalone technique and then applied in a real project, so hopefully it’s really sinking in!
