# <center>Project 4, part 1</center>

We’re starting a new project today, and we’re going to add some more SwiftUI skills to your collection while also tackling a fascinating area of programming: machine learning.

Nick Bostrom, a Swedish professor teaching at Oxford University, once said “machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to make.” Is that true? Well, it’s certainly true that if we can teach computers to think competently enough it would remove the need for humans to do that thinking, but on the other hand some might argue most of humanity doesn’t do much thinking in the first place.

Still, I think you’ll be impressed by how easy it is to get started, and how it’s a really natural fit inside SwiftUI.

As a side note, I want to add that by now you’re starting to settling into the frequency of this course: some studying, some app building, a technique project, then consolidation – all repeated several times over.

However, I want to say that if at any point you’re feeling tired, or if life just gets in the way, take a break! If you come back to your code in a day or two, you’ll be more relaxed and ready to learn. Like I said at the beginning, this is a marathon not a sprint, and you won’t learn effectively if you’re stressed.

**Today you have five topics to work through, and you’ll meet Stepper, DatePicker, DateFormatter, and more.**

 - BetterRest: Introduction
 - Entering numbers with Stepper
 - Selecting dates and times with DatePicker
 - Working with dates
 - Training a model with Create ML

Once you’ve made it through those topics, make sure and post your progress somewhere online – you’ve taken the first steps towards understanding machine learning!
