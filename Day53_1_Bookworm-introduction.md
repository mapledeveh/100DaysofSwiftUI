# Bookworm: Introduction

In this project we’re going to build an app to track which books you’ve read and what you thought of them, and it’s going to follow a similar theme to project 10: let’s take all the skills you’ve already mastered, then add some bonus new skills that take them all to a new level.

This time you’re going to meet Core Data, which is Apple’s battle-hardened framework for working with databases. This project will serve as an introduction for Core Data, but we’ll be going into much more detail soon.

At the same time, we’re also going to build our first custom user interface component – a star rating widget where the user can tap to leave a score for each book. This will mean introducing you to *another* property wrapper, called **@Binding** – trust me, it will all make sense.

As usual we’re going to start with a walkthrough of all the new techniques you need for this project, so please create a new iOS app called Bookworm, using the App template.

**Important: I know it’s tempting, but please don’t check the box marked Use Core Data**. It adds a whole bunch of unhelpful code to your project, and you’ll just need to delete it in order to follow along.
