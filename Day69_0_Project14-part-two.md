# <center> Project 14, part 2

In the second part of our technique overview for this project, we’re going to look at two really important frameworks on iOS: MapKit for rendering maps in our app, and LocalAuthentication for using Touch ID and Face ID.

It won’t surprise you to learn that location, fingerprints, and facial recognition are really personal to users, which means we need to treat them with respect at all times. Remember, users trust us to treat their data with the utmost care and intention at all times, so it’s a good thing to get into the mindset that privacy, security, and trust are your core values rather than optional extras.

Elvis Presley is reputed to have once said, “values are like fingerprints: nobody’s are the same, but you leave them all over the things you touch.” Well, this project is at the center of the Venn diagram of both values and fingerprints, so stay sharp – this stuff matters.

**Today you have two topics to work through, in which you’ll learn how embed maps into a SwiftUI app, how to use Face ID to unlock your app, and more.**

- Integrating MapKit with SwiftUI
- Using Touch ID and Face ID with SwiftUI
