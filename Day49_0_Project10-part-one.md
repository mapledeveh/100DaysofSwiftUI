# <center> Project 10, part 1

You’ve had a couple of days away from following projects, and I hope you used them to review what you’ve learned, write your own code for a while, and reflect on what was said in yesterday’s videos.

As the late, great Zig Ziglar said, “there are two sure ways to fail: think and never do, or do and never think.” Well, today is very much back to being a “do” day: we have a new project to build, which in turns means some new techniques to learn.

In particular, we’re going to go even deeper into Codable so you can get a feel for what’s happening behind the scenes when Swift can synthesize functionality for us. This is another step towards demystifying Swift and SwiftUI – it’s great to be able to rely on our tools to do work for us, but it’s also important to understand *what* they are doing.

**Today you have five topics to work through, in which you’ll learn about custom **Codable** implementations, **URLSession**, the **disabled()** modifier, and more.**

- Cupcake Corner: Introduction
- Adding Codable conformance for @Published properties
- Sending and receiving Codable data with URLSession and SwiftUI
- Loading an image from a remote server
- Validating and disabling forms
