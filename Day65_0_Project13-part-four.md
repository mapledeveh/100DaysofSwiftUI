# <center> Project 13, part 4

Today we’re going to be putting into practice some of the techniques you just learned, including how to create custom bindings, how to wrap **PHPickerViewController** for use inside SwiftUI, and how to apply Core Filter effects to an image.

One thing I hope you notice is how I frequently lead you back to a topic we looked at previously. This isn’t an accident: as the self-help author Napoleon Hill wrote, “any idea, plan, or purpose may be placed in the mind through repetition of thought” – this repetition is one of several approaches I use to help you internalize how all this code fits together.

And even if you don’t fully get these concepts today, that’s OK – we’ll be covering them again the future.

Today you have three topics to work through, in which you’ll put into practice wrapping a UIViewController for use with SwiftUI, filtering images using Core Image, and more.

- Building our basic UI
- Importing an image into SwiftUI using PHPickerViewController
- Basic image filtering using Core Image
