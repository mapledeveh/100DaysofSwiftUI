# <Milestone: Projects 10-12

That’s another three projects done, and more really important techniques under your belt. No matter how beautiful your design or how clever your app idea, it’s nearly always the case that handling your users’ data *well* is the most important thing for any good app.

Of course, the real discussion is what “well” means. At the very least I hope it means “with respect” – you don’t share anything without their consent, you don’t track their activity without permission, and you store any personal data carefully. Beyond that, you might want to add searching or filtering, you might want cloud synchronization so their data is shared across devices, you might want to let them browse or modify the raw data, and so on.

Regardless of what you do with it, learning to work with user data is a great skill to have, and you’ve taken lots of steps forward in these last three projects.

Now it’s time for a challenge, and unsurprisingly it will involve fetching, processing, and displaying lots of data. You already have all the skills you need to make this a great app, so all that remains is for you to crack open a new Xcode project and get stuck in.

Will you make mistakes? Yes – and that’s OK. British author Neil Gaiman had some advice that I hope will serve you well:

>I hope that in this year to come, you make mistakes. Because if you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something.

**Today you have three topics to work through, one of which of is your challenge.**

- What you learned
- Key points
- Challenge

**Note:** Don’t worry if you don’t complete challenges in the day they were assigned – in future days you’ll find you have some time to spare here and there, so challenges are something you can return back to in the future.
