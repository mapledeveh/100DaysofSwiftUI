# Project 17, part 6
With another app finished it’s time for you to review what you learned and also take on some challenges to make sure you really understand what was covered – two things that are easily skipped over, but two things that are central to great learning.

US president John F. Kennedy once said, “things do not happen – things are *made* to happen,” which really gets to the heart of these challenges. You need to step up the plate and write code yourself – make things happen yourself – because otherwise all you have is an idea. And as Steve Jobs said, “ideas without action aren't ideas – they're regrets.”

**Today you should work through the wrap up chapter for project 17, complete its review, then work through all three of its challenges.**
