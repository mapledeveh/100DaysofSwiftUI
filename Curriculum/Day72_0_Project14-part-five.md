# <center> Project 14, part 5

Today is the last day of coding for this project, and I’m sure you’re looking forward to the challenges and review tomorrow – it should make a nice change from such a long tutorial.

First, though, we need to cover off two tricky topics, one of which will really challenge you because we’ll remodel our code to use the MVVM design pattern. As you’ll see, this helps separate logic from layout in our projects, but it takes a bit of thinking too – not least because you need to understand the concept of the main actor.

While you’re working through today, chances are you’re really starting to feel the difficulty curve ramp up, because our projects are growing and size and complexity. I want to take this opportunity to remind you of a few things:

1. You’re not alone; everyone is having to go through this same learning curve.
2. It’s a marathon, not a sprint; take your time and it will come.
3. It’s OK to take a break and come at a topic again later; having fresh eyes will help.
4. There is no learning without struggle; if you’re fighting to learn something, it will stick way better at the end.

There’s a quote widely attributed to Confucius that you would do well to remember: “it doesn’t matter how slowly you go, as long as you don’t stop.”

**Today you have two topics to work through, in which you’ll learn how to write data to disk securely, and how to enable biometric authentication.**

- Introducing MVVM into your SwiftUI project
- Locking our UI behind Face ID

That’s another app done – make sure and share your progress with the world!
