# <center>Project 4, part 3</center>

This project was a chance for you to practice some fundamentals of SwiftUI, learn some new UI controls with **DatePicker** and **Stepper**, see for yourself how Swift makes it easy to handle dates, and – just for fun – dip your toe into the world of machine learning.

All these things work independently of each other, by which I mean you can now use **Stepper**, or **DateComponents**, or Create ML all by themselves, in other projects – the stuff you’ve learned can be taken anywhere you want. As you progress with SwiftUI you’ll add more and more of these jigsaw pieces, and in doing so you’ll find you soon have hundreds of pieces that you can rearrange and build together to make remarkable things.

One of my favorite Steve Jobs quotes is this:

> "Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and synthesize new things."

That’s where I want you to reach with SwiftUI – to know that when you have a new project idea you can reach for part of project 1, part of project 3, part of project 4, and beyond, and already be 75% towards your goal. You’ll get there – just keep coming back each day!

**Today you should work through the wrap up chapter for project 4, complete its review, then work through all three of its challenges.**
