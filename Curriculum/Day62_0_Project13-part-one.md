# <center> Project 13, part 1

This is the first of two projects that start looking at how we push beyond the boundaries of SwiftUI so that we can connect it to Apple’s other frameworks. Apple has provided approaches for us to do this, but it takes a little thinking – it’s very different from the regular SwiftUI code you’ve been writing so far, and it’s even quite different from the kind of code UIKit developers are used to!

Don’t worry, we’ll be tackling it step by step. I’ll provide the tutorials and a project to work towards; all you need to do is bring your brain and the willpower to push through. Remember, as the writer John Ortberg says, “if you want to walk on water, you have to get out of the boat”!

*Today you have four topics to work through, in which you’ll learn about responding to state changes, showing confirmation dialogs, and more.*

- Instafilter: Introduction
- How property wrappers become structs
- Responding to state changes using onChange()
- Showing multiple options with confirmationDialog()
