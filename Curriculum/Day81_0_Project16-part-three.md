# <center> Project 16, part 3

Today we’ll be looking at three important features: context menus in SwiftUI, notifications in iOS, and Swift package dependencies in Xcode. These are three more really key features for app developers to master, and I hope you’ll find that all of them are relatively easy to learn.

Context menus – those menus that pop up when you press and hold on something in iOS – allow us to add extra actions for views in our layouts. This is a great way to avoid adding clutter to your UI, but I want you to exercise caution when doing so. Scott Belsky, previously a VP at Adobe and now venture capitalist, once said that there’s one rule for designing a good user experience: “more options, more problems.”

So, by all means add extra functionality to your UI, but always think about discoverability. After all, if the user can’t find your actions they might as well not exist!

**Today you have three topics to work through, in which you’ll learn about context menus, local notifications, Swift package dependencies, and more.**

- Creating context menus
- Adding custom row swipe actions to a List
- Scheduling local notifications
- Adding Swift package dependencies in Xcode
