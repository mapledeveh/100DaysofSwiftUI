# <center> Milestone: Projects 13-15

You’ve completed two tough projects and another technique project, but your knowledge of SwiftUI is really starting to round out now – I certainly hope you’re starting to appreciate how much easier it is compared to Apple’s older frameworks!

Today it’s time to pause and reflect on what was covered. We’ll also be diving into two topics – operator overloading and property wrappers – in more detail, because in doing so you’ll gain a much deeper understanding of what we’ve been using. And there’s today’s *challenge*, where you’ll need to apply the skills you’ve learned to build a wholly new app.

Challenges offer you the chance to test your learning in a practical way, give you a sandbox where you can really express yourself and stretch yourself if you want, and I hope also show you just what you’re capable of when you put your mind to it. As Cicely Tyson said, “challenges make you discover things about yourself you never really knew,” and I hope you’re able to discover today just how far you’ve come!

**Today you have three topics to work through, one of which of is your challenge.**

- What you learned
- Key points
- Challenge

**Note:** Don’t worry if you don’t complete challenges in the day they were assigned – in future days you’ll find you have some time to spare here and there, so challenges are something you can return back to in the future.
