# <center> Project 13, part 2

Today we continue examining our project’s techniques, and we’re starting to venture more into places where SwiftUI feels a bit less pleasing to work with. Today you’re going to see how Core Image integrates with SwiftUI, and the answer is “not very well”. We’re also going to start looking at how UIKit integrates with SwiftUI, and again the answer isn’t great – we need to put in quite some work to squeeze UIKit’s round peg into a SwiftUI-shaped hole.

Would I want to see something better here? Absolutely – and perhaps it will come in a future update to SwiftUI. But there’s an anonymous saying I think fits well here: “never let the things you want make you forget the things you have.”

Yes, SwiftUI’s integration with other frameworks is a little shaky right now, but that doesn’t mean it should detract from the rest of the great work SwiftUI does for us.

**Today you have just two topics to work through, in which you’ll learn how to manipulate images using Core Image, and how to wrap UIKit code for SwiftUI.**

- Integrating Core Image with SwiftUI
- Wrapping a UIViewController in a SwiftUI view

If you have some spare time, try experimenting with Core Image and seeing what you can do – screenshots are always fun to share!
