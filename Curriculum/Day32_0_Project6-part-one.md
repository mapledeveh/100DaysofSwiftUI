# <center> Project 6, part 1

When Steve Jobs introduced Aqua, the visual theme that has powered macOS ever since Mac OS X launched in 2001, he said “we made the buttons on the screen look so good you'll want to lick them.” I don’t know if you were using Macs way back then, but over the years Aqua has given us glass-like buttons, pin stripes, brushed metal and so much more, and even today the “genie” window minimize looks amazing.

When we make apps with great visual appeal, users *notice*. Sure, it won’t affect the core functionality of the app, and it’s easy to go overboard with design and cause that core to get a little lost, but when you do it *right* a beautiful user interface brings a little extra delight and can help set your app apart from others.

Animations are one of the fundamental ways we can bring our apps to life, and you’ll be pleased to know SwiftUI gives us a range of tools for using them. Today we’ll be looking at easier animations, but tomorrow we’ll progress onto more difficult stuff – it’s a good idea to be aware of both, so you can tackle whatever problems come up in the future.

**Today you have five topics to work through, in which you’ll learn about implicit animations, explicit animations, binding animations, and more.**

- Animation: Introduction
- Creating implicit animations
- Customizing animations in SwiftUI
- Animating bindings
- Creating explicit animations
