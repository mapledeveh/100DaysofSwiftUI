# <center> Project 15, part 2

Today we’re going to go back through three of our earlier projects, highlighting accessibility problems and fixing them. This might seem like it might be a bit dull, but I want you to think again about what our goal is here: do we want to build software that benefits everyone?

I hope the answer is *yes*. There’s a New York lawyer called Gregory Mansfield who fights for disability rights, and he once wrote this: “Accessibility is not charity. Accessibility is not generosity. Accessibility is not an amenity. Accessibility is not a gratuity. You don’t bestow access – *you ensure it*.”

As you work through today’s three topics, I hope you’re pleasantly surprised by a) how easy this stuff really is, and b) how little it affects the rest of your code. And once you realize *that*, you’ll start to wonder why so many other app developers do such a poor job of making their apps accessible to everyone.

**Today you have three topics to work through, in which you’ll fix three projects we made earlier in this course.**

- Fixing Guess the Flag
- Fixing Word Scramble
- Fixing Bookworm
