# <center> Project 13, part 3

Believe it or not, we still have one more day of techniques for this project before we get into the implementation phase, and I’ve left the hardest stuff to the end.

Today you’re going to look at some of the complexities around how SwiftUI works with UIKit. If you’ve ever used UIKit before these things won’t be too taxing, but if UIKit is new to you then today might hurt almost as much as when you first met closures in Swift. Yes, really.

Stick with it! After today we’ll start putting all these concepts into action, so you’re really close to the fun part. Take your inspiration from the postage stamp – as the writer Josh Billings once quipped, “its usefulness consists in the ability to stick to one thing until it gets there.“

**Today you have just two topics to work through, in which you’ll learn about coordinators, delegates, NSObject, @objc, selectors, and other things that go bump in the night.**

- Using coordinators to manage SwiftUI view controllers
- How to save images to the user’s photo library
