# <center> Project 11, part 4

After a few days of following along with me making a project, it’s time for you to step out of your comfort zone and start writing your own code. Once again, these are challenges I’m setting you based on everything you’ve learned so far, which means they are absolutely within your grasp if you set your mind to it.

Amy Morin, a social worker turned author, once said “the more you practice tolerating discomfort, the more confidence you'll gain in your ability to accept new challenges.” This is the underlying goal in all these challenges: giving you a little nudge to try something yourself, to figure out what works, and – bluntly – to screw up a few times before you figure out the right solution.

There is value in getting things right, but there’s just as much value in getting things wrong. Embrace that – learn to tolerate the discomfort that goes hand-in-hand with writing fresh code yourself – and you’ll be a great developer.

Today you should work through the wrap up chapter for project 11, complete its review, then work through all three of its challenges.
