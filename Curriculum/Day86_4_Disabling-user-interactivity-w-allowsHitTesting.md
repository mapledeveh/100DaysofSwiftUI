# Disabling user interactivity with allowsHitTesting()

SwiftUI has an advanced hit testing algorithm that uses both the frame of a view and often also its contents. For example, if you add a tap gesture to a text view then all parts of the text view are tappable – you can’t tap through the text if you happen to press exactly where a space is. On the other hand, if you attach the same gesture to a circle then SwiftUI will ignore the transparent parts of the circle.

To demonstrate this, here’s a circle overlapping a rectangle using a **ZStack**, both with **onTapGesture()** modifiers:
```
ZStack {
    Rectangle()
        .fill(.blue)
        .frame(width: 300, height: 300)
        .onTapGesture {
            print("Rectangle tapped!")
        }

    Circle()
        .fill(.red)
        .frame(width: 300, height: 300)
        .onTapGesture {
            print("Circle tapped!")
        }
}
```
If you try that out, you’ll find that tapping inside the circle prints “Circle tapped”, but on the rectangle behind the circle prints “Rectangle tapped” – even though the circle actually has the same frame as the rectangle.

SwiftUI lets us control user interactivity in two useful ways, the first of which is the **allowsHitTesting()** modifier. When this is attached to a view with its parameter set to false, the view isn’t even considered tappable. That doesn’t mean it’s inert, though, just that it doesn’t catch any taps – things behind the view will get tapped instead.

Try adding it to our circle like this:
```
Circle()
    .fill(.red)
    .frame(width: 300, height: 300)
    .onTapGesture {
        print("Circle tapped!")
    }
    .allowsHitTesting(false)
```
Now tapping the circle will always print “Rectangle tapped!”, because the circle will refuses to respond to taps.

The other useful way of controlling user interactivity is with the **contentShape()** modifier, which lets us specify the tappable shape for something. By default the tappable shape for a circle is a circle of the same size, but you can specify a different shape instead like this:
```
Circle()
    .fill(.red)
    .frame(width: 300, height: 300)
    .contentShape(Rectangle())
    .onTapGesture {
        print("Circle tapped!")
    }
```
Where the **contentShape()** modifier really becomes useful is when you tap actions attached to stacks with spacers, because by default SwiftUI won’t trigger actions when a stack spacer is tapped.

Here’s an example you can try out:
```
VStack {
    Text("Hello")
    Spacer().frame(height: 100)
    Text("World")
}
.onTapGesture {
    print("VStack tapped!")
}
```
If you run that you’ll find you can tap the “Hello” label and the “World” label, but not the space in between. However, if we use **contentShape(Rectangle())** on the **VStack** then the whole area for the stack becomes tappable, including the spacer:
```
VStack {
    Text("Hello")
    Spacer().frame(height: 100)
    Text("World")
}
.contentShape(Rectangle())
.onTapGesture {
    print("VStack tapped!")
}
```
