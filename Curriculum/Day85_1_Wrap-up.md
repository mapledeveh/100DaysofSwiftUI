# Hot Prospects: Wrap up

This was our largest project yet, but the end result is another really useful app that could easily form the starting point for a real conference. Along the way we also learned about custom environment objects, **TabView**, **Result**, **objectWillChange**, image interpolation, context menus, local notifications, Swift package dependencies, **filter()** and **map()**, and so much more – it’s been packed!

We’ve explored several of Apple’s other frameworks now – Core ML, MapKit, Core Image, and now UserNotifications – so I hope you’re getting a sense of just how much we can build just by relying on all the work Apple has already done for us.

# Challenge

1. Add an icon to the “Everyone” screen showing whether a prospect was contacted or not.
2. Use JSON and the documents directory for saving and loading our user data.
3. Use a confirmation dialog to customize the way users are sorted in each tab – by name or by most recent.
