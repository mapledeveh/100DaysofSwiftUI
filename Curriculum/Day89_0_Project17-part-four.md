# Project 17, part 4

As we continue our project implementation, you’ll see how we add a timer to give folks a little incentive to think quickly, how we end the app whether they finish in time or not, but also how we can make some simple adjustments to our layout to help make sure our app works well for folks with red/green color blindness.

Although we looked at accessibility in its own dedicated technique project, here we’re focusing on one specific accessibility need. With 1 in 12 men having color blindness this is a surprisingly common accessibility need to have, but as the accessibility advocate Debra Ruh says, “accessibility allows us to tap into everyone’s potential.”

Don’t let your code hold someone back because of the way they were born.

**Today you have three topics to work through, in which you’ll add color coding to our gestures, use a timer to show progress, and more.**

- Coloring views as we swipe
- Counting down with a Timer
- Ending the app with allowsHitTesting()
