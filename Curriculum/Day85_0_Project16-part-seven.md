# Project 16, part 7

The British mathematician Isaac Newton once said, “if I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” That’s a pretty humble view to take for someone who is one of the most influential scientists of all time!

I think the same is very much true of working with Apple’s APIs. Could I have written Create ML myself? Or UIKit? Or MapKit, or Core Image, or UserNotifications? Maybe *one* of them, and perhaps if I had a lot of help *two* of them, but it’s pretty unlikely.

Fortunately, I don’t need to, and neither do you: Apple’s vast collection of APIs means we too are standing on the shoulders of giants. Even things like handling dates well is a huge amount of work, but it’s something we don’t need to worry about because Apple already solved it for us.

So, seize this amazing opportunity! Build something great that combines two, three, or more frameworks and then add your own customizations on top. It’s those final steps that really set your app apart from the pack, and where you add your own value.

**Today you should work through the wrap up chapter for project 16, complete its review, then work through all three of its challenges.**
