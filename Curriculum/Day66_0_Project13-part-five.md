# <center> Project 13, part 5

It’s time to put the finishing touches to our app, which will allow the user to experiment with different Core Image filters then save their result to the photo library.

Today’s work requires us to return back to some of the UIKit warts we met earlier, namely **@objc**, **#selector**, and **NSObject**, along with the quirky-at-best strongly typed API for Core Image. There is ample room for mistakes here, so take your time, double check your code against mine, and remember Mosher’s Law of Software Engineering: “Don’t worry if it doesn’t work right – if everything did, you’d be out of a job.”

**Today you have two topics to work through, in which you’ll put into practice action sheets, saving images, and more.**

- Customizing our filter using confirmationDialog()
- Saving the filtered image using UIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbum()

That’s another app done – don’t forget to share your progress with the world!
