# Project 17, part 5

Today we wrap up our program by adding some final features and also fixing a ton of bugs. Yes, our program has bugs, and I’m going to walk you through some of them and also show you how to fix them.

When you’re learning to program, finding bugs in your code can feel disheartening because it feels like you’ve screwed up. But as legendary Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra once said, “if debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in."

In other words, fixing bugs is par for the course when you’re developing software, because we aren’t perfect. The more comfortable you are with creating bugs, finding bugs, and *fixing* bugs, the better a developer you’ll be.

**Today you have three topics to work through, in which you’ll add haptic feedback, fix many of the bugs in our app, then add a new screen to edit cards.**

- Making iPhones vibrate with UINotificationFeedbackGenerator
- Fixing the bugs
- Adding and deleting cards

That’s another huge app finished – make sure you share your progress with others!
