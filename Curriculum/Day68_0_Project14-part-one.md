# <center> Project 14, part 1
You’ll be pleased to know that today is the easiest day you will have had in a while. That doesn’t mean we’re looking at unimportant stuff, only that the new techniques we’re covering are pretty much guaranteed to be a welcome break from the coordinators, selectors, and more you’ve recently had to face.

All I can is this: enjoy it while it lasts! Tomorrow we’re back on to the hard stuff, which I hope shouldn’t come as a surprise given that you’re well past the two-thirds mark in these 100 days.

Keep going! As Vince Lombardi said, “the only place success comes before work is in the dictionary.”

**Today you have four topics to work through, in which you’ll learn how about implementing **Comparable**, finding the user’s documents directory, and more.**

- Bucket List: Introduction
- Adding conformance to Comparable for custom types
- Writing data to the documents directory
- Switching view states with enums
