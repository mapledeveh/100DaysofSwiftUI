# <center> Project 14, part 3

It’s time to start putting all our techniques into practice, which means building a map view where we can add and interact with annotations. As we progress, I’d like you to reflect a little on how our app benefits from all the standard design affordances that come with iOS, and what means for our users – they already know how to use maps, and how to tap on markers to activate functionality,

Years ago, Steve Jobs said “design is not just what it looks like and feels like; design is how it works.” Users know how our map works because it works just like every other map on iOS. This means they can get on board with our app *fast*, and means we can focus on directing them towards the part of our app that’s unique and interesting.

**Today you have three topics to work through, in which we take a really deep dive into integrating MapKit with SwiftUI.**

- Adding user locations to a map
- Improving our map annotations
- Selecting and editing map annotations
