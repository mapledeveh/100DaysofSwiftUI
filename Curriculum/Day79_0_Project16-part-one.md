# <center> Project 16, part 1

Now that you’ve crossed the hump of working with UIKit, we can get back to the happier place of working in pure SwiftUI – and I think you’ll appreciate it even more now!

In this project you’re going to be learning a really great mix of features from both Swift and SwiftUI; it will really help push your skills forward and give you the flexibility to create powerful apps. Yes, even here at 79 days through our 100 there are still lots of new things to learn – as Lily Tomlin said, “the road to success is always under construction”!

**Today you have three topics to work through, in which you’ll learn about custom environment objects, tab views, and more.**

- Hot Prospects: Introduction
- Reading custom values from the environment with @EnvironmentObject
- Creating tabs with TabView and tabItem()
