# <center>Project 5, part 1

It’s time for another new project, and this is actually the last easy project we have on this course – after this the difficulty level ramps up a little as we tackle bigger apps, so enjoy this while it lasts!

In this app you’ll work with two of the real fundamentals of app development: **List** for working with tables of data, and strings, for handling text. Yes, we covered strings quite a bit already, but now we’re *really* going to dig into them, including how to work with their Unicode representation so we can get compatibility with older Objective-C frameworks.

Unicode is a standard for storing and representing text, which at first glance you might think sounds easy. But trust me on this: it really isn’t. You know how I said dates are hard? Well, dates are *easy* compared to storing text properly. In fact, there’s even a joke mug you can buy that says “I ? Unicode” – a painful reminder that when text representation goes bad all you see is a question mark where the symbol should be.

**Today you have four topics to work through, and you’ll meet *List, Bundle, UITextChecker*, and more.**
