# <center> Project 6, part 3
Diana Scharf-Hunt once said, “goals are dreams with deadlines.” Well, we know your goal is to learn SwiftUI because that’s why you’re here, so it’s time to add a deadline too: your mission today is to complete three animation challenges that will really put your skills – and your creativity! – to the test.

As you’ll see, one of the challenges today specifically asks you to be creative and try something yourself. You have all the tools now to create a huge variety of animations and transitions, so all that’s holding you back is the opportunity to practice.

Well, this is it – good luck!

**Today you should work through the wrap up chapter for project 6, complete its review, then work through all three of its challenges.**
