# <center>Project 5, part 2

Now that you understand the techniques necessary for this project, today we'll be implementing our game. Yes, there will be a fair chunk of practice here, and yes, hopefully this will be an easy project for you. But that shouldn't stop you from tackling it with gusto – give it your best shot!

Try to keep in mind some famous words from the American writer and lecturer Dale Carnegie:

>"Don't be afraid to give your best to what seemingly are small jobs. Every time you conquer one it makes you strong – if you do the little jobs well, the big ones will tend to care of themselves."

Working with lists, arrays, text fields and more should definitely be little jobs for you by now, but one of the goals of this course is to give you a truly rock solid foundations in those fundamentals, backed up by a knowledge of what greater things are also possible.

In the future I want you to be able to look at a sketch of an app idea and know exactly how to build it before you've even written a line of code, because ultimately it can be broken down into a series of little jobs.

And if you *still* find it too easy, relax: tomorrow is the challenge day!

**Today you have three topics to work through, and you'll put into practice everything you learned about *List, UITextChecker*, and more.**

- Adding to a list of words
- Running code when our app launches
- Validating words with UITextChecker
