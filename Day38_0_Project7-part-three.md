# <center>Project 7, part 3

That’s another project done, and another massive amount of Swift and SwiftUI knowledge covered. There are more projects to cover, but as F1 racer Sebastian Vettel once said, “sometimes you need to press pause to let everything sink in.”

Today is your chance to press pause and let SwiftUI sink in. Complete the review, take the challenges, and, if you need to, go back to previous consolidation day challenges and work on them.

So many people email me with questions like “how fast can I learn app development?” and honestly I feel sorry for them. *You can’t learn when you rush*. The two goals are incompatible with your brain. Focused learning is when we actively consume information through studying and that’s really important, but *diffuse* learning is when we stop studying and let our brain passively make connections between what we already studied. Taking a break, sleeping, or working on something else for a while are all important parts of the process.

So, if you’re keen to rush ahead to tomorrow’s new project, please follow Vettel’s advice: press pause and let everything sink in.

**Today you should work through the wrap up chapter for project 7, complete its review, then work through all three of its challenges.**
