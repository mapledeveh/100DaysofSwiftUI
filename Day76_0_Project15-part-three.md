# <center> Project 15, part 3

Now that you’ve seen how easy it is to fix up our projects, it’s time for you to continue that job with some challenges and a review of what you’ve learned. I think you won’t find it hard at all, and perhaps even will continue to be surprised at how easy SwiftUI makes accessibility.

Steve Ballmer (yes, *that* Steve Ballmer) once said “accessible design is good design – it benefits people who don’t have disabilities as well as people who do.” And he’s right: taking the time to make sure your app works for everyone will provide long-lasting benefits for all your users.

**Today you should work through the wrap up chapter for project 15, complete its review, then work through all three of its challenges.**
