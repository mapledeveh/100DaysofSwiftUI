Instafilter: Wrap up
Paul Hudson     @twostraws    December 6th 2021

We covered a lot of ground in this tutorial, and we’ll be coming back to a lot of it in the very next project – working with UIKit isn’t a “nice to have” for most apps, so it’s best you get used to it and start building up your library of functionality wrappers.

Still, we also learned some great SwiftUI stuff, including confirmation dialogs and **onChange()**, both of which are super common and will continue to be useful for years to come.

And there’s Core Image. This is another one Apple’s extremely powerful frameworks that never quite made the smooth leap to Swift – you need to know it’s quirks if you want to make the most of it. Still, you’re through the worst of it now, so hopefully you can try using it in your own code!

# Challenge
One of the best ways to learn is to write your own code as often as possible, so here are three ways you should try extending this app to make sure you fully understand what’s going on.

1. Try making the Save button disabled if there is no image in the image view.
2. Experiment with having more than one slider, to control each of the input keys you care about. For example, you might have one for radius and one for intensity.
3. Explore the range of available Core Image filters, and add any three of your choosing to the app.

**Tip:** That last one might be a little trickier than you expect. Why? Maybe have a think about it for 10 seconds!
