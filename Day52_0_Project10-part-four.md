# <center>Project 10, part 4
Every new project we work on here introduces new concepts to you in isolation and then again in the context of a real app, with the goal being that showing you the same thing twice in different circumstances helps it sink deeper into your long-term memory.

But today, with our app finished, it’s time for another important part of the long-term process: a test of what you remember, and some challenges to help push you further. Like it or not, this step *matters* – as the astronaut John Young once said, “the greatest enemy of progress is the illusion of knowledge.”

Trust me on this: *knowing* you understand something is way better than *thinking* you understand it. This is why I keep drilling the essentials into you: I want you to get so bored with **Form** that you could almost write this course yourself. I want you to see **Codable** and know exactly what it means and how it works behind the scenes, and never to think to yourself that it’s somehow magic.

All these foundations we’re building here are going to last you for years, and it means everything you build on top – everything you learn or create in the future – isn’t built on top of half understanding something you read once, but is instead something you can have real, lasting confidence about.

**Today you should work through the wrap up chapter for project 10, complete its review, then work through all three of its challenges.**
