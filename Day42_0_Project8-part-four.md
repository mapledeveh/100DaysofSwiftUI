# <center> Project 8, part 4

You’ve now finished Moonshot, which is the first of our projects that started to get difficult – it took longer to explain, we used custom SwiftUI layouts, and I even snuck in a few advanced Swift features. Not all our future projects are going to be difficult, but it’s certainly going to be the case that they are more *complex*; there is more to them, which means the resulting apps are more interesting, and also more representative of real-world app building.

As the complexity rises so do the odds of making mistakes, and Swift is pretty unforgiving here – as you will undoubtedly have seen by now, even one small mistake on line 20 can result in a random error appearing on line 5, and this can be disheartening.

Well, I hope today’s quote will inspire you. I’ve chosen it specially for today for reasons best left to the reader, but it’s this: don’t panic! These sorts of problems are common, and the easiest way to solve them right now is to comment out whatever code you most recently added, and keep doing so until your code works. You can then slowly re-introduce code until you find the part that causes your compile to break, then fix it.

So, don’t panic – you can do this!

**Today you should work through the wrap up chapter for project 8, complete its review, then work through all three of its challenges.**
