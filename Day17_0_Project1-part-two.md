As Immanuel Kant said, “experience without theory is blind, but theory without experience is mere intellectual play.” Yesterday we covered almost all the techniques required to build this app, so now it’s time to turn all that head knowledge into a real, practical app.

One of the things I love about SwiftUI is how easily this transition from theory to practice is – there are no surprises lurking around the corner and no epic extra new things to learn along the way.

Sure, I’ll sneak in a couple of tiny things just to keep you on your toes, but for the most part you already know everything you need to build this project, so now it’s just a matter of seeing how things fit together.

### Today you have four topics to work through, in which you’ll apply your knowledge of **Form, @State, Picker**, and more.
 - Reading text from the user with TextField
 - Creating pickers in a form
 - Adding a segmented control for tip percentages
 - Calculating the total per person
 - Hiding the keyboard
