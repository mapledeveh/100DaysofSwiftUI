# <center>Project 1, part one</center>

Now that you’ve mastered the basics of the Swift language, it’s time to start applying your skills to some real code in our first project.

This project is a check-sharing app that calculates how to split a check based on the number of people and how much tip you want to leave. The project in itself isn’t complicated, but we’ll be taking it slow so you can see exactly how these fundamentals fit together.

In some respects going back to the basics like this will feel odd – you’ve learned about closures, optionals, and throwing functions, and now there’s a bit of a reset as we look at the basics of SwiftUI. But take hope: there’s a lot of value in being able to approach new topics with a fresh mind. As Meister Eckhart said, “be willing to be a beginner every single morning” – do that, and you’ll learn much faster.

Today is the project overview day, which is where we’ll be looking at the isolated pieces of code that you need to understand in order to build our project. Tomorrow we’ll move on to the implementation day, where you’ll put those new techniques into practice with our app.

### Today you have seven topics to work through, and you’ll meet **Form, NavigationView, @State**, and more.

 - WeSplit: Introduction
 - Understanding the basic structure of a SwiftUI app
 - Creating a form
 - Adding a navigation bar
 - Modifying program state
 - Binding state to user interface controls
 - Creating views in a loop
